# Lessons

## Breadboard
- connected wires on vertical edges
- connected wires throughout horizontal rows

## resistors
### basics
- currents flows from (+) to (-)
- resistors limit current
- from ohms law, V = I.R
- resistors used to protect low power devices like LEDs

### color bands
- 4 band and 5 band
- follow color codes or use multimeter

## LEDs
- Bulbs are heat generating devices, 95% heat, 5% light.
- LEDs are light generating devices.
- diodes are semi-conductor based.
- energy moves from high to low, (n-type to p-type), thus releasing light.
